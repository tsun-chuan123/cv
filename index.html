            <p>Hello! My name is Tsun-chuan Wang.
            <br>I graduated from National Ilan University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree
            <br>in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering.</p>

            <h3>Redesign Of The Rotary Compressor Motor</h3>
            <p>During my university years, I chose to participate in the department head's project on "Design and Application of High-Efficiency Motors," which became a challenge to improve my abilities in planning and executing research projects. In this project, we identified business opportunities in the motor market and planned to find efficient and practical solutions to replace traditional motors. We analyzed the rising trend in raw material prices, compared different types of motors, conducted efficiency statistics and loss calculations, and worked hard to find the best design method.I understand that success requires continuous adjustment and accumulation, driving me to pursue better solutions constantly.</p>
            <h3>The Development Of Situational Robots</h3>
            <p>With a theoretical foundation in "Dynamics and Automatic Control" from my professional field, the course on "Robotics" enabled me to study the movement patterns of various joints in robotic arms through the integration of theoretical knowledge and practical applications. I learned how to control robots in real-world scenarios, including simulating the myCobot 280 in the RViz simulation environment to achieve effective control over a six-axis robotic arm. For our final project, our group focused on "Smart Cup Service by Robotic Arm," where the robotic arm was used to pour water and grasp objects, aiming to improve the quality of life for individuals with mobility challenges by providing greater autonomy and independence, making it easier to handle daily activities. This learning experience has given me insight into the challenges and opportunities of robotic arms in practical applications and taught me how to apply technology to solve real-life problems.</p>
